Keeper keeps things for you, primarily receipts for purchases.

## The Idea

A Keeper instance is deployed for a single family. A Family has many 'trays' (in/out trays) and receipts are added to trays. A family member gets their own tray where they can store receipts privately but additional shared trays can be created to share with the rest of the family.

## Configuration

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
